FEEDBACK:

Good testing of a deep copy of your linked lists.
	However, for future clarify what the test case is showing,
	or in the element of the linked list that has been updated.
	Otherwise, it is difficult to pinpoint the changes.


Nice clean implementation of cloning elements of your linked list.

-Bita.
